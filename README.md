# Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to build out visualization tools in order for me to better understand `muon` which is an optimizer for neural networks.

I use `manim` which is basically the library that underpins a lot of the visualizations from 3Blue1Brown (which is a fantastic Youtube channel if you're not familiar). All of the code can we be found in `understanding_muon`. Visualization code will be found under `understanding_muon/viz`. There's a high liklihood I use some `jupyter lab` notebooks and throw those in `understanding_muon/notebooks`.

The core reference blog that I'm working on is going to be symlinked. That is the `reference_blog_post.md` file.
